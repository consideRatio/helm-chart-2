# This is a GitHub workflow defining a set of jobs with a set of steps.
# ref: https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions
#
# This workflow has a job to monitor the daskdev/dask image tags and compares
# them to the version of the Helm chart's appVersion. If they are not in sync, a
# PR is automatically created to update the Helm charts by replacing the old
# version with the new.
#
# This workflow has another two jobs to monitor the versions of the JupyterHub
# Helm chart and Dask-Gateway Helm charts which should trigger a PR to be
# created bumping daskhub/Chart.yaml's dependency version pinning.
